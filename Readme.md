# This Small Project Covers Running Cypress Test Scripts on:

1. A docker container locally (without cypress installed on the host machine)
2. CI/CD (Github Actions):
- Without Docker, directly on the github runners inside an ubuntu machine
- With docker, docker container inside github runners 

---

## Running Cypress API Tests in Docker container in host machine

### 1. Local Setup and Test Validation

Before using Docker, it is important to verify that your Cypress tests work locally.

#### Steps
1. Install Cypress locally
2. Write a basic API test
3. Run the test locally to ensure it passes

#### Important
To run `npm ci` inside a Docker container, a `package-lock.json` file **must exist**.

#### Generate `package-lock.json`

powershell
```
npm install
```

Now, create a dockerfile to run these tests in a docker container

Here, Image Choice is important, for cypress, there are 3 available images:

DECISION of image

| Image              | Suitable for project?    | Why                                              |
|--------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| cypress/included   | ✅ YES (Recommended)     | Zero setup, Cypress + Node + browsers included   |
| cypress/browsers   | ⚠️ Maybe later           | Requires installing Cypress yourself             |
| cypress/base       | ❌ No                    | Requires installing Cypress + browsers           |
| cypress/factory    | ❌ No (advanced)         | Used to build custom images                      |


Docker File
```

FROM cypress/included:15.8.1

WORKDIR /myApp

COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

RUN npm ci

COPY . .

```

Folder structure inside container:

```
/myApp
├── cypress/
│   └── e2e/
│       └── api.cy.ts
├── node_modules/
│   ├── cypress/          # Cypress binary already present in image
│   ├── typescript/
│   └── ...
├── Dockerfile            # copied but not used inside container
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── cypress.config.ts     # (if/when you add it)

```

After Creating dockerfile, we may delete the cypress we installed in our local machine

Command:

powershell
```
yarn remove cypress
```

Verify removal:

powershell 
```
yarn cypress --version
```

Now, Build an image from our app. Image tag used: cypress-docker

powershell
```
docker build -t cypress-docker .
```

Run a container from this image and that container should be removed after the run:

powershell
```
docker run -rm cypress-docker
```

And the tests are now run inside container with cypress installed, we don't have cypress setup locally.

## SOME IMPORTANT POINTS:

### 1. npm install vs npm ci

package.json defines allowed versions, but package-lock.json defines installed versions — and npm ci trusts only the lockfile.

#### npm install

npm install installs dependencies based on package.json and may use package-lock.json.
If version ranges allow it, npm can resolve newer compatible versions and update the lockfile.

- Updates package-lock.json
- Slower compared to npm ci
- Suitable for local development, not ideal for CI

#### What happens with npm install

1. npm reads package.json
2. Sees ^18.3.1
3. Resolves the latest compatible version (say 18.3.4)
4. Updates package-lock.json and Installs that version
5. If a new compatible version is released later, the next npm install may pull:

```
18.3.5 → different dependency tree → possible test break
```
This is where flakiness comes from.

#### Risks while testing:

Two CI runs can install slightly different dependency trees → tests pass in one run and fail in another.

#### npm ci

npm ci is designed for continuous integration. It installs dependencies exactly as specified in package-lock.json, ensuring reproducible and deterministic builds.

- Deletes node_modules before installing
- Fails if package.json and package-lock.json are out of sync
- Does not modify the lockfile
- Faster and more reliable
- Guarantees consistent test environments

#### What happens with npm ci

- npm ignores version ranges in package.json
- Reads exact versions from package-lock.json and Installs exactly those versions
- Fails if package-lock.json doesn’t match package.json

Example lockfile entry:
```
"react": {
  "version": "18.3.2",
  "resolved": "...",
  "integrity": "..."
}
```

npm ci will always install 18.3.2, even if 18.3.5 exists and package.json allows it (^18.3.1)

### 2. Entrypoint vs CMD

#### High-level difference

- ENTRYPOINT defines what the container is,
- CMD defines what the container does by default.


#### CMD


Provides default arguments or a default command
Can be overridden easily at runtime

```
CMD ["npm", "test"]
```

Runtime override

```
docker run my-image npm run smoke
```

➡️ CMD is replaced.

#### Risk in CI

Someone can override CMD and accidentally skip tests.

#### ENTRYPOINT

Defines the fixed executable that always runs
Cannot be overridden accidentally (unless explicitly forced)

```
ENTRYPOINT ["npm"]
CMD ["test"]
```

Runtime behavior

```
docker run my-image run smoke
```

➡️ Executes:

```
npm run smoke
```

Prevents accidental bypassing of automation
Safer for CI and production pipelines

# Little Theory --> Components of Github actions

### Workflow 👉 The whole plan

- A workflow is a set of steps that run automatically.
- It is written in a YAML file and stored in .github/workflows/.
- Think of it as a recipe.

### Event 👉 The trigger

- An event tells GitHub when to run the workflow.
- Pushing code (push), Creating a pull request (pull_request), Clicking a button manually (workflow_dispatch)

### Job 👉 A big task

A workflow contains one or more jobs. Each job does something important, 
like:
- Run tests
- Build the app
- Deploy the app
Jobs usually run in parallel.
Think of a job as a worker doing a task.

### Runner 👉 The machine that does the work

- A runner is the computer that runs the job.
- GitHub provides runners like: Ubuntu, Windows, macOS

Think of it as the computer that follows the instructions.

### Step 👉 Small actions inside a job

- A job is made of steps.

- Each step does one small thing:
1. Checkout code
2. Install dependencies
3. Run a command

Think of steps as instructions in the recipe.

### YAML File 👉 Where everything is written

- Workflows are written in YAML.
- It describes: When to run, What jobs to run, What steps to follow


Simple Mental Picture
```
Event happens
   ↓
Workflow starts
   ↓
Jobs run
   ↓
Steps execute
   ↓
Actions help
   ↓
Runner does the work

## Running Cypress API Tests in Github Actions (Without Docker)

We will create a yaml file first in the location ROOT -> .github/workflows/file.yml:

Refer this in Repo
```
.github\workflows\withoutDocker.yml
```

Refer these Screenshots
```
YAML SCREENSHOTS
```
In yaml file, we can see prewritten actions like actions/checkout@v4

I have created 3 jobs:
- build job that creates node modules
- two parallely executing jobs that runs int-1 and int-2 specs separately

Each GitHub Actions job runs on a fresh, separate VM.

That means:
- build-job runs on Machine A
- api-int-1 runs on Machine B
- api-int-2 runs on Machine C

Nothing (files, node_modules, caches) is shared automatically between them.
I used cache to share node_modules between jobs

GitHub cache works like this:
```

Cache Storage (GitHub)
       ↑     ↓
build-job  api-int-1  api-int-2

GitHub caches are stored on GitHub’s infrastructure, not inside your repo and not permanently on the runner.
```

## In each job I created, this happens:

```
VM starts empty
npm cache is restored (if available)
npm ci creates a new node_modules folder
Tests/build run
VM is destroyed

node_modules is built separately in each job.
```

```
## What Is Reused vs Rebuilt

| Thing                 | Reused? | How                          |
|-----------------------|---------|------------------------------|
| npm package downloads | ✅ Yes  | GitHub cache (`~/.npm`)      |
| Cypress binary        | ✅ Yes  | npm cache                    |
| node_modules folder   | ❌ No   | Rebuilt every job            |
| Compiled JS / TS      | ❌ No   | Job-local                    |
| OS filesystem         | ❌ No   | New VM                       |

```

Even though node_modules is rebuilt, npm does not download packages again

It just:

- Copies from cache
- Extracts tarballs
- Links binaries

That’s why cached installs are usually seconds, not minutes.

## What I avoided

❌ Share node_modules via artifacts
❌ Skip npm ci in test jobs
❌ Assume jobs share filesystems

Those approaches cause:

- Flaky builds
- OS / path issues
- Cypress binary mismatches

## My Subsequent Runs workflow

Subsequent runs / parallel jobs (warm cache)

In every job Cache is restored (~/.npm)

npm ci:

- Does NOT download packages
- Does NOT download Cypress again
- Extracts packages from cache
- Recreates node_modules
- Links binaries (node_modules/.bin)

➡️ No network downloads
➡️ Only filesystem work
